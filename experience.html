	<h2>FREELANCER</h2>
	<p>I started using the freelancer platform this year because of UBM599. My first impression when using this platform was kind of amazing because we can find and do the job online. I try to apply for various kinds of jobs, such as translator, logo designer, data entry, and any other job that I cannot remember because I apply for many of them based on my height, and the jobs must be within my abilities. Here, let me share a little bit about a freelancer: Freelancer is a marketplace where employers and employees are able to find each other. The site allows employers to post work for site members who place bids in a competitive tender process. The site also allows members to host and enter contests for which prize money is offered as a reward. Freelancers and employers develop profiles on the site as they offer, win, and complete work, and write and receive reviews of people they work with or for. The site's members receive a finite number of bids to use on the site, which are periodically replenished. A series of account options are offered, ranging from free accounts to professional subscriptions.</p>

	<h2>CITY CAMPUS BADMINTON CLUB</h2>
	<p>City Campus Badminton Club, or CCBC, is one of the clubs at UiTM Kota Bharu. I started joining this club only this year. On December 7–8, 2023, I went on a visit to the Malaysian badminton association. The place of visit is Bukit Kiara, Kuala Lumpur. There, we learn about the history of badminton and the mission and vision of the Malaysian badminton team. We can also watch professional and new player practice. </p>
